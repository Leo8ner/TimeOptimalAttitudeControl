Equally precise.Use test.cu next steps: convert it to a usable class, create library, use it as a casadi external function.

1. Generate Callback------------look at claude its finally happening :)
1.1 Provide jacobian - this
1.2 Provide hessian
2. Export it as external library
3. Import it as external function


How to use acado -> does it support numerical integrators?
Can I have the jacobian as an output of the CUDAOptimizer as well?
